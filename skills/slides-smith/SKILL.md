## Workflow Classifier

Score the request, then state the selected workflow before editing.

| Dimension         | 0                     | 1                     | 2                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Files touched     | one slide file        | slides + styles/tests | plugins/docs/config/export scripts      |
| User-visible risk | copy-only             | layout/navigation     | build, plugin, export, or docs behavior |
| Source clarity    | full content provided | partial outline       | vague goal or legacy input              |
| Fidelity need     | normal web deck       | polished talk         | PDF/PPTX parity or brand-critical       |

| Score | Tier          | Strategy                                                            |
| ----- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-2   | Simple        | Edit directly, run focused validation                               |
| 3-5   | Standard      | Inspect docs/code, make minimal changes, run relevant suite         |
| 6-8   | Comprehensive | Plan briefly, split research/implementation/QA, run full validation |

## Core Process

### Inspect

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and the target slide/docs files before changing code.
2. Preserve topology: root app, `docs/` site, `packages/ui/` primitives, no `apps/` directory.
3. Resolve "active deck" through `src/slides/active-deck.tsx` and `src/slides/active-deck-metadata.ts`, not by assuming `src/slides/Presentation.tsx` is rendered.
4. Prefer `@revealjs/react` components: `Deck`, `Slide`, `Stack`, `Fragment`, `Code`, and `Markdown`.
5. Let `@revealjs/react` own Reveal initialization, cleanup, sync, events, and config updates.
6. Use React props or Reveal `data-*` attributes for backgrounds, transitions, fragments, notes, auto-animate, and lightbox behavior.
7. Keep the default plugin array stable and small unless the user explicitly asks for a default policy change.
8. Build the smallest correct change, then validate with the repo scripts.

### Implement

- Common deck work stays in this body plus `references/authoring-patterns.md`.
- Plugin, migration, or docs work loads `references/repo-workflows.md`.
- Export work loads `references/export-workflows.md` before choosing tools.
- Completion work loads `references/validation.md` before final reporting.

## PowerPoint Export Logic

Choose export path by intent, not by file extension alone.

| User Need                      | Preferred Path                   | Output  | Trade-Off                                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Editable text-first deck       | Pandoc Markdown to PPTX          | `.pptx` | Good editability, limited Reveal styling |
| Visual fidelity to Reveal deck | Screenshot-backed PptxGenJS deck | `.pptx` | Pixel-faithful, text not editable        |
| Native editable designed PPTX  | PptxGenJS shape generation       | `.pptx` | Best control, needs a custom script      |
| Speaker handout / delivery     | Reveal PDF export                | `.pdf`  | Best supported by Reveal, not PPTX       |
| Legacy `.ppt` required         | PPTX then LibreOffice convert    | `.ppt`  | Compatibility path, may lose fidelity    |

Default to asking one question when PPTX intent is unclear: `editable content` or `visual fidelity`. If the user says “best” without choosing, prefer editable Pandoc for outline-heavy decks and screenshot-backed PptxGenJS for polished visual decks.

## Scaling Strategy

| Scope                       | Execution                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2 slides                  | Single-pass edit plus focused browser/test validation                                                     |
| 3-10 slides                 | Create outline, implement sections, then visual/accessibility pass                                        |
| Full deck                   | Build narrative arc first, implement in chunks, validate after each major section                         |
| Plugin/export/config change | Inspect metadata/docs/tests first, update all policy surfaces together                                    |
| Legacy migration            | Archive source, port intentionally, keep generated/vendor output out unless needed for runnable snapshots |

## Reference File Index

Do not load every reference by default. Load only the file needed for the selected workflow.

| File                               | Content                                                       | Read When                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `references/repo-workflows.md`     | Repo map, commands, default plugin policy, migration rules    | Any codebase workflow          |
| `references/authoring-patterns.md` | Slide structure, design, React Reveal patterns, accessibility | Create, edit, design, polish   |
| `references/export-workflows.md`   | PDF, PPTX, PPT strategy with Pandoc/PptxGenJS/LibreOffice     | Export workflows               |
| `references/validation.md`         | Validation matrix, browser QA, failure triage                 | Validate, release, after edits |

## Progressive Disclosure

Use the dispatch table and classifier first. Load `references/*.md` only when the workflow requires deeper repo, authoring, export, or validation guidance.

## Validation Contract

Maintainer-only skill-definition checks are for edits to `skills/slides-smith/`, not normal deck workflows. Before declaring this project-local skill complete, run the local checks from the slides repo and the audit from the agents repo. Set `SLIDES_REPO` to this repo root and `AGENTS_REPO` to the local agents repo first:

```bash
SLIDES_REPO=/path/to/slides
AGENTS_REPO=/path/to/agents

cd "$SLIDES_REPO"
uv run wagents validate
uv run wagents eval validate

# Proof command shape for generic skill audit checkers: audit.py skills/slides-smith/
uv run python "$AGENTS_REPO/skills/skill-creator/scripts/audit.py" skills/slides-smith/
```

Do not require `uv run wagents package slides-smith --dry-run` for this project-local skill. The current packager resolves skill names from the central agents repo and fails unless this skill is promoted there first.

Before declaring slide-deck work complete, run the relevant repo validation from `references/validation.md`. Full completion requires zero errors or an explicit note about any command that could not run.

## Critical Rules

1. Never add `apps/` or move the root slides app without explicit user approval.
2. Never register the Reveal Markdown plugin by default; use React `Markdown` for markdown slides.
3. Never mutate `src/lib/reveal-plugins.ts` without also syncing plugin metadata, bundle guards, README, and docs.
4. Never add a community plugin to defaults when an opt-in preset satisfies the deck need.
5. Always run `pnpm validate:plugin-presets` after changing preset modules or optional plugin dependencies.
6. Always run `pnpm validate:slides` after build, Reveal config, plugin, or slide-structure changes.
7. Always run `pnpm test:e2e` after navigation, layout, interaction, accessibility, or export-affecting changes.
8. Do not add export dependencies or scripts without checking existing `package.json` first.
9. For PPTX export, explicitly classify editability vs visual fidelity before choosing Pandoc or PptxGenJS.
10. Keep archived `legacy/` content out of active lint/build paths unless intentionally porting it.
